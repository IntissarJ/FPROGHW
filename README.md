# Functional Programming Homework Lessons (F#)

## Overview
These lessons focus on mastering **Functional Programming** concepts with **F#**, a functional-first language. All exercises are completed using **Jupyter Notebooks**, which provide an interactive environment for writing and testing F# code. Through hands-on coding, you will explore key concepts of functional programming in a dynamic way.

## Topics Covered
- **Introduction to Functional Programming**  
  Understand the foundational concepts of functional programming, including immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions.

- **Pure Functions**  
  Learn about the significance of pure functions in functional programming, emphasizing their role in avoiding side effects and ensuring predictable outcomes.

- **Lambda Expressions and Anonymous Functions**  
  Get familiar with the use of lambda functions and anonymous functions in F#, understanding their power in writing concise and expressive code.

- **Pattern Matching**  
  Master pattern matching as a powerful feature in F#, enabling easy manipulation of data structures like lists, tuples, and records.

- **Recursion**  
  Explore recursion in F# as an alternative to iterative constructs, and understand how recursive functions can replace traditional loops.

- **Higher-Order Functions**  
  Learn how higher-order functions can be used to manipulate and transform data, such as `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.

- **Immutability and Persistent Data Structures**  
  Focus on the importance of immutability in functional programming and how F# handles immutable collections like lists and arrays.

- **Type Systems in F#**  
  Understand F#â€™s strong, static type system and how type inference works to ensure correctness and reduce the need for explicit type annotations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **F# in Jupyter Notebooks**  
  The lessons are structured using Jupyter notebooks that support F#. This interactive setup allows you to execute F# code directly in the notebook, making it easy to learn and experiment with functional programming concepts.

- **F# Language**  
  F# is a functional-first programming language, which supports features like first-class functions, immutability, and type inference that are core to functional programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
1. Understand and apply functional programming principles using F#.
2. Implement pure functions, recursion, and higher-order functions effectively in real-world problems.
3. Work with F#'s powerful type system and pattern matching to write robust and maintainable code.
4. Use immutability and persistent data structures to handle data transformations in a functional style.

## Getting Started
To get started, open the provided Jupyter notebooks containing F# code. Each notebook includes explanations, example code, and exercises to reinforce your understanding of functional programming concepts.
